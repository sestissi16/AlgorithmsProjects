# AlgorithmsProjects
Algorithm projects done in Python and C for CS-310. 

## What's included:
These programming projects deal with merge sort and graphs specifically.

The merge sort files are in the folder 'MergeSortFiles' and the graph files are in the folder 'AlgorithmsFinalProject'.

This class is also where I began learning C and so my first exploration of C and its syntax is in the folder 'C-PracticeFiles'.

PythonHashTables.py has my code where I hash an array of numbers.
